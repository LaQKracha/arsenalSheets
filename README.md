# Arsenal Cheat Sheets

Just a repository with my arsenal cheatsheets! ðŸ’»ðŸ”¥

In this repository, you'll find a treasure trove of handy commands for hacking.

## How to Use

Just clone the repository, find your arsenal directory and put this bad boys there, then you just need to open arsenal and boom! your commands are there. ðŸ’¥ðŸ¤¯
Alternatively you can add another specific path to arsenal editing the ```/arsenal/modules/config.py``` in a section like this:

```python
CHEATS_PATHS = [
    join(BASEPATH, "cheats"), # DEFAULT
    join(HOMEPATH, "docs/my_cheats")
]
```
And there you go! âœ…

```bash
git clone 
cd 
```
